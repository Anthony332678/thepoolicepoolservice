How Often Should You Shock Your Pool?<h2>
Shocking a pool is essential for maintaining clean and safe water. It eliminates bacteria, algae, and contaminants that regular chlorination may not fully remove. The frequency of shocking depends on several factors, including usage, weather conditions, and water quality.
%%
General Guidelines for Pool Shocking<h2>

<list>
Every 1–2 Weeks: For regular maintenance, shocking every one to two weeks helps keep the water clear and free of harmful bacteria.^^
After Heavy Use: If you’ve had a pool party or lots of swimmers, shock the pool immediately to break down sweat, body oils, and other organic materials.^^
Following Rainstorms: Rainwater can introduce contaminants and dilute chlorine levels. Shocking the pool helps restore balance.^^
When Algae Appears: If you notice green, yellow, or black algae, a strong shock treatment is necessary to kill the growth and prevent further spread.^^
At the Start and End of the Season: Shock the pool when opening it for summer and before closing it for winter to maintain water quality.
